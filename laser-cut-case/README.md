Laser Cut Case
--------------

We designed a case to be cut from 1/8 inch plywood on a laser cutter.
The tabbed box outline was created by a plugin tool in the Inkscape
application.  It was modified from there to produce the correct
holes for our speaker and microphone, the power supply, and 
ventilation for the heat produced by the raspberry pi.

Hot glue was used to hold the speaker and microphone in place.
Wood glue was used to secure the wood panels to each other.
The left panel with the finger hole was not glued.  This allows
for access to the components if necessary.  It stays in place
by friction, as long as it is not removed frequently.

[etch-cut-test.svg](etch-cut-test.svg) can be used to make small test
cuts to configure the power settings on your laser cutter.

[case-inkscape.svg](case-inkscape.svg) can be modified to put your
own design on the box.  Etching/engraving is *very* slow.  We actually
did low-power vector cuts of our design elements.  It looks nice,
and takes about 1/10 the time as engraving.
