Laser Cut Case
--------------

We designed a case to be cut from 1/8 inch plywood on a laser cutter.
The tabbed box outline was created by a plugin tool in the Inkscape
application.  It was modified from there to produce the correct
holes for our speaker and microphone, the power supply, and 
ventilation for the heat produced by the raspberry pi.

[etch-cut-test.svg](etch-cut-test.svg) can be used to make small test
cuts to configure the power settings on your laser cutter.

[case-inkscape.svg](case-inkscape.svg) can be modified to put your
own design on the box.  Etching/engraving is *very* slow.  We actually
did low-power vector cuts of our design elements.  It looks nice,
and takes about 1/10 the time as engraving.
